- **(Unit 1) Microservices March 2023: Start Delivering Microservices**

  ## Details
  
  [Register online](https://www.nginx.com/c/microservices-march-2023/?utm_medium=virtualevent&utm_source=meetup&utm_campaign=ww-nx_ssap_g&utm_content=ev-) to access Microservices March.

  Microservices March 2023 is a free educational program that addresses some of the key fundamentals of delivering microservices. The entire curriculum is eight hours of activities spread out over four weeks. Do it all or pick just the parts that interest you.

  This program is 101-focused. Youâ€™ll benefit most if youâ€™re transitioning into a company already using microservices, are currently deciding on an architecture, or are about to start your own conversion to microservices.

  - Unit 1: Apply the Twelve-Factor App to Microservices Architectures
  - Unit 2: Microservices Secrets Management 101
  - Unit 3: Accelerate Microservices Deployments with Automation
  - Unit 4: Manage Microservices Chaos and Complexity with Observability

  ## Unit 1: Apply the Twelve-Factor App to Microservices Architectures

  The first publication of the Twelve-Factor App manifesto was in 2011, now over ten years ago. Since then, many of the practices outlined in that document have become so commonplace that itâ€™s difficult to imagine doing things any other way. 
  
  While most of the practices are just as effortless to apply in the context of microservices, others require special consideration both in their technical implementation and their socialization among teams. In this session we highlight some of the areas that may have hidden surprises and help you avoid that pain in your transition to microservices.

  Join this session to learn:

  - Which of the Twelve Factors need extra attention in microservices
  - How the confluence of team organization and microservices affects your decision making

  ## Hands-on Lab - 1 hour

  Youâ€™ll learn about the different types of configuration and informational data, and how to apply them to a service.
